### Action Item

Review the lesson resources on task transitions and experiment with adjusting the number of transitions. Observe what happens when multiple transitions feed into a no-op, while also tweaking the task transition criteria sensitivity. This will help you understand how different sensitivity levels affect the workflow's behavior and execution paths in various scenarios.

Start thinking about how you'd like to implement error handling in your workflows. Consider whether you'd prefer simple feedback messages, detailed error logs, or automated corrective actions. Defining clear criteria for handling different types of errors can ensure smoother workflow execution and make troubleshooting more efficient.
