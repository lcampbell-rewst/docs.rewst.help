# Welcome And Enrollment

## Getting Started

To kick off your automation journey, we have an entire [getting-started](getting-started/ "mention") section dedicated to introducing you to both automation practices as well as the Rewst Platform itself. Dive in and get your talons wet with the basics, including some exercises!

## Live Training Enrollment

Next, let’s dive right in. We’ve created a six-part training plan, ideally taken over two weeks. You’ll start with building a simple form and workflow, then improve it through iteration as you move forward. The last two weeks shift to hands-on practice at your own pace. If you stick to it, you’ll have your [certification](rewst-foundations-10x/foundations-certification.md) in only a month!&#x20;

To maximize your learning experience, it's recommended to complete the six courses in order. On-demand recordings of the sessions are available for our global audience, or rewatching at your own pace.

## On-Demand Training

Suggested schedule aside, don’t let it overwhelm you: this content is also self-paced! We offer courses sequentially, but you can use the self-serve resources or attend the next watch party on your schedule. &#x20;

Use the hyperlinks below to get started with each session, and let us know if you hit a roadblock along the way, or have questions in our [Cluck University Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/WKwsZngc).&#x20;
