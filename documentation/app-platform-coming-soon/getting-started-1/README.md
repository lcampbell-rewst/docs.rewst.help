# Getting Started

#### Welcome to the App Builder Getting Started Guide!

Welcome, and congratulations on taking the first step toward building your first app on the App Builder platform! In this guide, we will walk you through creating your very first App, starting with a simple "Hello World" project. As we progress, you'll learn how to build powerful workflows, design user-friendly pages, and leverage the platform's in-built components to create your app without needing extensive coding experience.

**Why App Builder?**

Whether you're streamlining internal processes, enhancing user experiences, or developing entirely new services, App Builder enables you to create Apps with minimal effort and maximum flexibility.

With the App Builder platform, you can:

* Create Apps with ease, using drag-and-drop interfaces and pre-built components.
* Utilise Rewst workflows and Jinja with a beautiful branded frontend that can be used by your techs and end users alike.
* Design modern, stylised pages with built-in tools, eventually expanding to full CSS customisation for a professional, polished finish.

**What We'll Accomplish**

In this guide, we’ll focus on:

1. **Creating Your First App**: A simple "Hello World" to introduce the basics.
2. **Building Your First Page**: Learn how to add structure to your app.
3. **Designing a Workflow**: See how workflows bring your app to life.
4. **Utilising Built-in Components**: Make your app functional with ready-made building blocks.

As we move through these steps, we’ll gradually evolve our project into a fully-functional Forms Portal—a complete system that your users can interact with. Later on, we’ll add CSS styling to ensure that your app not only works well but also looks great.

**What’s Next?**

We’ll start with the basics to get you comfortable with the platform. You’ll soon see how easy it is to build and scale your Apps. Each section of this guide will build on the last, taking you from a simple "Hello World" to a professional, end-user-friendly portal.

Let’s dive in and start building your first app!
