# Rewst's Technical Documentation Guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to Rewst's Technical Documentation Guidelines. Here, we delve into the specifics and technical expectations required to create best-in-class documentation, all while maintaining the distinctive Rewst voice and tone.

## Core Principles

### Clarity and Precision

* **Technical Accuracy:** Ensure every piece of information is technically correct and up-to-date.
* **Detail-Oriented:** Provide comprehensive details without overwhelming the reader. Focus on essential elements to guide users effectively.

### Consistency

* **Standardized Format:** Use a consistent structure across all documents. This includes headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists for easy navigation.
* **Terminology:** Maintain uniformity in terms. If a specific term is used to describe a feature or process, stick to it throughout the documentation.

### Approachable Technical Language

* **Balancing Technicality and Accessibility:** While technical accuracy is key, the language should be approachable. Avoid overly complex jargon.
* **User-Centric Writing:** Frame technical details in a way that resonates with the user's experience. Explain how features and processes benefit them.

### Engaging and Interactive Content

* **Visual Aids:** Incorporate diagrams, screenshots, and videos where appropriate to aid understanding.
* **Interactive Elements:** Include step-by-step tutorials, interactive examples, or simulations to enhance engagement.

### Documentation Structure

#### Introduction

* **Objective:** Clearly state the purpose of the document. What will the user learn or accomplish by the end?
* **Scope:** Define the scope of the content. What aspects of the product or feature will it cover?

#### Body

* **Sequential Flow:** Information should flow logically, building upon each concept or step.
* **Actionable Steps:** Present instructions or information in actionable steps, ensuring they are easy to follow and implement, including examples and visuals where relevant.

#### Conclusion

* **Recap:** Briefly summarize key points or steps.
* **Further Resources:** Link to related documents or external resources for additional learning.

### Dos and Don'ts

#### Do:

* Use a friendly, conversational tone, as if explaining concepts to a colleague over coffee.
* Include real-life examples or use cases to demonstrate application.

#### Don't:

* Overwhelm the reader with technical information without practical context.
* Stray from the Rewst tone of being direct and succinct.

### Conclusion

Our technical documentation is a reflection of our commitment to empowering users with knowledge. By adhering to these guidelines, we create resources that are not just informative but also engaging, accessible, and reflective of the Rewst brand.
