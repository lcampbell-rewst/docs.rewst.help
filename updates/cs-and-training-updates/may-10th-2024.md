* **Game Tip for the Week:** THE SWITCH 2 HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE PRESIDENT OF NINTENDO THIS IS NOT A DRILL! So hold on to your butts as the internet goes into a frenzy over every rumor from the deepest recesses of the internet to tell us it's either a low-powered piece of garbage or the greatest piece of gaming innovation to grace the planet Earth.&#x20;
* **SHOUT OUT** to Chris, Josh, Jason, Michael, Michael (two this week!), David, and Alaura for successfully taking our [foundations-certification.md](../../cluck-university/rewst-foundations-10x/foundations-certification.md "mention") Exam, and collecting your prestigious **Certified Rewster** badge in Discord.&#x20;
* Clea is BACK! Next week, we will continue our regular schedule of Clea on the 100s and Eddie on the 200s!
