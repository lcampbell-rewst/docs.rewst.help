<summary><strong>General News and Reminders</strong></summary>

* **Game Tips for the Week:** We're going Modern and Retro again today!
  * **Modern**: Super Mario Thousand Year Door is out! So you should definitely check that out if you have a Switch! (I know, this is cheating a bit)
  * **Retro**: If you haven't already played the Pokemon TCG Gameboy game, you should play it! It's on the NSO. If you HAVE played it, you should get the english translation pack for the sequel that never came out in the west. Because it's 🔥
* **SHOUT OUT** to Darren, Pepijn, Tyler, Mansoor, Gary, and Sarah for successfully taking our [foundations-certification.md](../../cluck-university/rewst-foundations-10x/foundations-certification.md "mention") Exam, and collecting your prestigious **Certified Rewster** badge in Discord. &#x20;
* Speaking of perks for our Certified Rewsters, we are re-Introducing the **ROC AMA**! When you get certified, you will be able to jump on an hour call with our awesome ROC Team to ask anything on Tuesdays, starting **June 4th**! [You can sign-up on Calendly now](https://calendly.com/cluck-u/roc-ama?month=2024-06)!
* Clea will also be running the entire Foundations series including the 106, starting next week!
