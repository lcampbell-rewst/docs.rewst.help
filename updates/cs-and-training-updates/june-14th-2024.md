<summary><strong>General News and Reminders</strong></summary>

* **Game Tip of the Week:** If you're looking for a CRAZY RPG, Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance is out today! Otherwise, you can go back to your Gameboy Advance games like I am. Speaking of which, if you're looking for something different, but want the old style of Pokemon games, I've just discovered fan games that are legitimately good. Check out Pokemon Unbound if you haven't already!
* **SHOUT OUT** to Jim, Wali, Alfredo, Austin, Paul, Andre, Andy, and Greg for successfully taking our [foundations-certification.md](../../cluck-university/rewst-foundations/foundations-certification.md "mention") Exam, and collecting your prestigious **Certified Rewster** badge in Discord. &#x20;
* **REMINDER**: [Sign up for the Office Hours](https://calendly.com/cluck-u/office-hours?) and the[ ROC AMA](https://calendly.com/cluck-u/roc-ama) to work through any questions you have during and after training!
* **FLOW REMINDER**: The Week of June 17th, the 200s Live Trainings, Fast Track Onboardings, Office Hours, and the ROC AMA will be paused. However, Clea's got your back with some 100 series Training!&#x20;
