* **Game Tip of the Week:**
  * If you saw the PS5 Pro announcement and are tempted to get that limited edition that's probably going to be over $1000, don't. You can get a Switch or Steamdeck with a ton of games for that or a whole 2 retro RPGs. Spend your money the right way 😉&#x20;
* **SHOUT OUTS** **TO:**
  * Victoria, Allen, Michael H., Michael R., Aaron, Linden, Austin, Ethan, and Adam
    * AND Ray and Tim with perfect scores :confetti\_ball:
  * Take the [foundations-certification.md](../../cluck-university/rewst-foundations-10x/foundations-certification.md "mention") Exam, and collect your prestigious **Certified Rewster** badge in Discord. As well as access to a super secret Discord channel.
