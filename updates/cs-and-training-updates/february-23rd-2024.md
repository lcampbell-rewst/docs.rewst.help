<summary><strong>General News and Reminders</strong></summary>

* **Game Tip for the Week:** In an effort to not just talk about Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for the next several months, I'll just ask if anyone is excited about any of the Nintendo Direct Announcements. Let us know in the chat! Otherwise, my tip is... to get Rebirth. :smile:
* **SHOUT OUT** to Brayden, Jeremy, and our very own Tricia Timney for successfully taking our [foundations-certification.md](../../cluck-university/rewst-foundations-10x/foundations-certification.md "mention")Exam, and collecting your prestigious **Certified Rewster** badge in Discord.&#x20;
* For those joining us at **Right of Boom** who couldn't get into the pre-day, we've opened up more seats! You can modify your registration to add our pre-day now!
* Join us in our [Cluck-U Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/936789089703845988/1121465945295167588) if you have any questions, comments, or concerns!
