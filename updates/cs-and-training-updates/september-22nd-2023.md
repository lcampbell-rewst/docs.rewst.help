<summary><strong>Tickets</strong></summary>

With the ROC now using Halo for their ticketing system, this is when you should find a ticket created for you!

* [x] A discussion with a ROC engineer that doesn't result in a fix on first discussion
* [x] If you have a call to troubleshoot, create workflows or other ROC work
* [x] For all onboarding or expansion work
* [x] If a call results in a new workflow idea or request

If you'd like to manually create a ticket yourself, review the "Rewst Support" section at the bottom of this page.
