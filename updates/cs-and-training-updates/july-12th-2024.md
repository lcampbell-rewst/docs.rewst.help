<summary><strong>General News and Reminders</strong></summary>

* **Game Tip of the Week:** I am happy to say we have our very FIRST game tip of the week submitted by Sir Logan! You should check out Traveller's Rest on Steam! It's a game in early access with a ton of awesome updates coming. My take is it looks similar to Stardew Valley but instead of just farming, you're goal is to become the best tavern keeper in the realm! Sounds legit.&#x20;
* **SHOUT OUTS** **TO:**
  * Tom, Tim, Nalin, David, Dustin, Zachary, Nicholas, Skyler, William, Jeremy, Eulogio, Mike
  * Bryan :100: and Sander :100: with perfect scores
  * Congrats on them for passing the [foundations-certification.md](../../cluck-university/rewst-foundations-10x/foundations-certification.md "mention") Exam, and collecting your prestigious **Certified Rewster** badge in Discord. &#x20;
* Join us in our [Cluck-U Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/936789089703845988/1121465945295167588) if you have any questions, comments, or concerns!
