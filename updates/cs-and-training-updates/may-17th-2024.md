* **Game Tip for the Week:** I have two today!
  * For the retro gamers out there, Anbernic just dropped an SP Clamshell handheld PC with emulators pre-loaded on it and it's dirt cheap. The most powerful model is only $75. So if you're a sucker for the GBA SP like me, check it out!
  * For all you modern gamers! ... This is still Retro kind of. Paper Mario Thousand Year Door Remake comes out next Thursday on Switch! So check it out!&#x20;
* **SHOUT OUT** to Emmitt, Gareth, Tanner, William, Doaa, and Anthony (with a PERFECT SCORE) for successfully taking our [foundations-certification.md](../../cluck-university/rewst-foundations-10x/foundations-certification.md "mention") Exam, and collecting your prestigious **Certified Rewster** badge in Discord.&#x20;
* Speaking of Tanner, Anthony, and Will, welcome our newest ROC members!
* If you're coming to MSPGeekCon, come check us out! We may or may not have something new and exciting and definitely not a shirt...&#x20;
