<summary><strong>General News and Reminders</strong></summary>

* **Game Tip for the Week:** We're going retro this week! If you want a cheap and very fun way to exercise and you still have a PS2, you can STILL buy PS2 dancepads on ebay for cheap and the DDR games are dirt cheap as well.
* **SHOUT OUT** to Philippe, Paul, Ryan, Stephen, Sebastian, and Daemon for successfully taking our [foundations-certification.md](../../cluck-university/rewst-foundations-10x/foundations-certification.md "mention") Exam, and collecting your prestigious **Certified Rewster** badge in Discord.&#x20;
* Eddie will be back next week with the 100 and current 200 series!
