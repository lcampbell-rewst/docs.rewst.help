* **Game Tip for the Week:** Not a game, but the Fallout show is getting some great reviews, so check it out if you're interested! Otherwise get back to trying to keep up with Persona, Like a Dragon, Rebirth, Hell Divers, or any other game you're trying to finish before the next wave of games coming in!
* **SHOUT OUT** to Nick, Hubert, Morgan, Cory, Danny, and Chantal for successfully taking our [foundations-certification.md](../../cluck-university/rewst-foundations/foundations-certification.md "mention") Exam, and collecting your prestigious **Certified Rewster** badge in Discord.&#x20;
