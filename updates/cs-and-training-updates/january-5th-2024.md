<summary><strong>General News and Reminders</strong></summary>

* **Game Suggestion for the Week:** I'm looking to make a video on my Retro Brandon YouTube channel that covers automation in a game for kicks. I think Stardew Valley should be the game, but let me know if you have any RPG or game that has concepts of automation that I could take a look at!
* **SHOUT OUT** to all those who've successfully taken our [foundations-certification.md](../../cluck-university/rewst-foundations/foundations-certification.md "mention")Exam, and collected your prestigious **Certified Rewster** badge in Discord.&#x20;
  * Stay tuned for more information on how to get your official certification issued for sharing on LinkedIn, and hanging on your wall with pride.

* **Reminder about the Rewst Onsite:**
  * We are BACK to our regularly scheduled training. You can sign up for our live training at [https://calendly.com/cluck-u](https://calendly.com/cluck-u)
  * Training will be paused again the week of **January 22nd** due to the Rewst Onsite!&#x20;
  * Feel free to sit by the fire, with a glass of bourbon, or tasty leftover New Year drinks, and watch our videos while you wait with anticipation for our return on **January 29th**.
