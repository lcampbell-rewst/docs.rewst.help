<summary><strong>General News and Reminders</strong></summary>

* **Game Tip for the Week:** BRACE YOURSELVES THE GAME SALES ARE COMING! In particular, I want to point out to all my Xbox owners here that Lost Odyssey, one of the most criminally overlooked RPGs of all time, is on sale digitally for $6.24 at the Xbox store. I would always recommend getting the original physical version, but this will be the best $6.24 you've ever spent in your life.&#x20;
